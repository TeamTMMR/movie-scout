Movie Scout App

##### Overview 
Movie Scout App was created with the purpose of allowing its users to build a list of movies to watch. The app uses Ruby on Rails to host React components in a monolithic application. The Devise gem was used for authorization and authentication. We have two tables in our database: the user and movie tables.
